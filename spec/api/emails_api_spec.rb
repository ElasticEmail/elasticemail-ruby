#Elastic Email REST API

#This API is based on the REST API architecture, allowing the user to easily manage their data with this resource-based approach.    Every API call is established on which specific request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) will be used.    The API has a limit of 20 concurrent connections and a hard timeout of 600 seconds per request.    To start using this API, you will need your Access Token (available <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://app.elasticemail.com/marketing/settings/new/manage-api\">here</a>). Remember to keep it safe. Required access levels are listed in the given requestâ€™s description.    Downloadable library clients can be found in our Github repository <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/ElasticEmail?tab=repositories&q=%22rest+api%22+in%3Areadme\">here</a>
